3.	Ask which direction the user wants to count (count up or count down). 
If they select up, then ask them for the top number and count from 1 to 
that number. If they select down, ask them to enter a number below 20 
and then count down from 20 to that number. If they entered a selection 
for something other than up or down, display an error message "I don't understand".
Use only for-loop for the count down printing iterative process.
